INSERT SCREENSHOTS!!!

### Lighthouse

The website is tested in Lighthouse, both for mobile and desktop.

#### Mobile

For mobile devices, the performance is 94. The low score is mainly due to the video at the first page. For the moment, the developer doesn't have the skill to fix it due to lack of knowledge in JavaScript.

#### Desktop

For desktop, the performance is 99.

### Wave Webaim - accessibility testing

You can test your site for accessibility through the wave.webaim site - it needs to be deployed in order for it to test it. Fix any errors that it gives

### Manual Testing

You need to perform, and document everything you did to manually test your site.
At a minimum - you need to check every link on every page works as intended.
So that is check every link in the nav bar (do this on every single page because its a link in a different file) and any other links that appear on your site.
Test the responsiveness of the site - you can do this in the dev tools in responsive mode.
You should also load the site once deployed on as many devices you have access to. What is different from one device to the next? why is it different?

Test the user stories that you created earlier in the readme - did you satisfy the goal, how?

To write up the tests you can use a table,
| Feature being tested | Expected Outcome | Testing Performed | Actual Outcome | Result (Pass or fail) |

You should have tests for every section of every page.. individually.
