### Bugs

During the testing some bugs were found.

When the HTML validation was done the first time, it was an error which said anchor tags weren't supposed to be in button tags. It was changed by changing the code to another solution. It didn't get any errors at the next validation. This code was changed once again to make the code easier and more accesible for screen readers.

When the site was tested in Lighthouse, it gave some improvment tips in making the image files smaller to make the loading speed faster. It was made for the image at Get involved page. The hero image at the index page were cropped to make the loading faster.

When the accessibility testing was made in Wave Webaim, one error occured. It was "Empty form label" in the nav bar. It was corrected by adding a Toggle menu text which was made to be hidden, but able to be read by screen readers.

During the contrast test one value was changed to increase the readability. The header and footer originally had #648C94 as background color and #04050A as font color. This combination gave a score of 5.5, equal AA. The background color was changed to #7A9Ea5 which gave a score at 7, equal AAA.
